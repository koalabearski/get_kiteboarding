# IDEAS

# WEATHER MODEL
* use a sin curve to forecast weather with some random jitter
* use actual historical wind data to "replay" a season
* assume gusts go up to twice the steady wind speed and are the primary indicator of wind speed

# THE GEAR
* what if you scraped for real-time eBay data for kites? 

# FRILLS
* events like the politics that happen on the beach - some dialog on handling them
* a cheesy 8-bit graphic of a kiteboarder (ala California Surf / Ski or Die)
* change units, knots -> kph, Celsius to Far, etc.

# DECISION MAKING
* introduce persistance to your decisions by passing along the data to each call?
* add constraints of time and money
* save results to disk so you can run stats
