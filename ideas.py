# IDEAS

# WEATHER MODEL
  # use a sin curve to forecast weather with some random jitter

# THE GEAR
# what if you scraped for real-time eBay data for kites?  

# FRILLS
  # events like the politics that happen on the beach - some dialog on handling them
  # a cheesy 8-bit graphic of a kiteboarder (ala California Surf / Ski or Die)
  # change units, knots -> kph, Celsius to Far, etc.
